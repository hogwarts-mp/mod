/**
 * Helper functions for processes that fork in order to share memory pages.
 *
 * About multithreading:
 * When a process gets forked, any existing threads will not exist on the new forked process.
 * To solve this we use forkable threads that are notified when the fork occurs and will automatically convert themselves into real runnable threads.
 * On the master process, these forkable threads will be fake threads that are executed on the main thread and will block the critical path.
 *
 * Currently the game code is responsible for calling Fork on itself than calling FForkProcessHelper::OnForkingOccured to transform the forkable threads.
 * Ideally the fork point is done right after the game has loaded all the assets it wants to share so it can maximize the shared memory pool.
 * From the fork point any memory page that gets written into by a forked process will be transferred into a unique page for this process.
