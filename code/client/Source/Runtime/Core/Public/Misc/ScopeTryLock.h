/**
 * Implements a scope lock using TryLock.

 * This is a utility class that handles scope level locking using TryLock.
 * Scope locking helps to avoid programming errors by which a lock is acquired
 * and never released.
 *
 * <code>
 *	{
 *		// Try to acquire a lock on CriticalSection for the current scope.
 *		FScopeTryLock ScopeTryLock(CriticalSection);
 *		// Check that the lock was acquired.
 *		if (ScopeTryLock.IsLocked())
 *		{
 *			// If the lock was acquired, we can safely access resources protected
 *			// by the lock.
 *		}
 *		// When ScopeTryLock goes out of scope, the critical section will be
 *		// released if it was ever acquired.
 *	}
