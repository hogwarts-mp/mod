/**
 * Simple API for system threads. 
 * Before using, please make sure you really need a new system thread. By default and in the majority of cases
 * parallel processing should be done by TaskGraph.
 * For richer functionality check `FRunnable`/`FRunnableThread`.
 * It's up to user to provide a way to notify the thread function to exit on demand.
 * Before destroying the instance it must be either `Join`ed or `Detach`ed.
 * Example:
 *		FThread Thread{TEXT("New thread"), []() { do_something_important(); }};
 *		// ... continue in the caller thread
 *		Thread.Join();
 * For more verbose example check `TestTypicalUseCase` in `ThreadTest.cpp`
