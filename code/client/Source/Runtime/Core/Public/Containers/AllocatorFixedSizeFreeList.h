/**
 * Fixed-sized allocator that uses a free list to cache allocations.
 * Initial allocation block can be specified in the ctor to warm the cache.
 * Subsequent allocations are in multiples of the given blocksize.
 *
 * Grow can be called at any time to warm the cache with a single block allocation.
 * Initial allocation will want to be a reasonable guess as to how big the pool might grow.
 * BlockSize should be small enough to cut down on allocations but not overcommit memory.
 *
 * NOTE: Currently there is not way to flush the pool because 
 *       it doesn't track each block's allocation status.
 *
 * Not threadsafe <could be implemented using a ThreadingPolicy template parameter>.
 *
 * Template params:
 *   AllocationSize - size of each allocation (must be at least as large as a pointer)
 *   BlockSize - number of allocations to reserve room for when a new block needs to be allocated.
