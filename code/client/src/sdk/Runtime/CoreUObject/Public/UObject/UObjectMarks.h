/** 
 * Object marks are bits associated with UObject. Marks are:
 * - Never saved
 * - Temporary and usually not valid outside of the scope of some function
 * - Low performance (!) Careful here, do not use marks for performance critical things.
 * - Public in the sense that the thing marking the objects is treating objects generically and is often not a uobject
 *
 * This is primarily a legacy support subsystem. Unwinding the scope, lifetime and relationship between marks was not 
 * feasible, so the legacy marks are all grouped here.
 * New mark-like things should probably just be new custom annotations.
 *
 * An alternative design would have been to incorporate marks into the UObjectArray.
 * That would allow high performance iteration, and could save memory if the marks are not sparse.
 * This design was chosen to avoid coupling.
