/**
 * Interface for "runnable" objects.
 *
 * A runnable object is an object that is "run" on an arbitrary thread. The call usage pattern is
 * Init(), Run(), Exit(). The thread that is going to "run" this object always uses those calling
 * semantics. It does this on the thread that is created so that any thread specific uses (TLS, etc.)
 * are available in the contexts of those calls. A "runnable" does all initialization in Init().
 *
 * If initialization fails, the thread stops execution and returns an error code. If it succeeds,
 * Run() is called where the real threaded work is done. Upon completion, Exit() is called to allow
 * correct clean up.
