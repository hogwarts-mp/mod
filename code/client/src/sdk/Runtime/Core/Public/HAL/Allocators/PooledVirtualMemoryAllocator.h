/**
 * This class pools OS allocations made from FMallocBinned2.
 * 
 * The class fulfills FMallocBinned2 requirements of returning a 64KB-aligned address
 * and it also avoids fragmenting the memory into too many small VMAs (virtual memory areas).
 * 
 * The logic is like follows:
 * 
 * There are N buckets that represent allocation sizes from 64KB to N*64 KB. Each bucket is a linked list 
 * of pools that hold varied number of same-sized allocations (called blocks). Each bucket starts empty (linked list is empty).
 * 
 * Whenever an allocation request arrives, it is first bucketed based on its size (if it is larger than the largest bucket,
 * it is passed through to a caching OS allocator). Then, the linked list of that bucket is walked, and 
 * the allocation is fulfilled by the first pool that has empty "blocks". If there are no such pool, a new pool is created 
 * (with number of blocks being possibly larger than in the existing list, if any), this pool becomes the new head of the 
 * list and the allocation happens there.
 * 
 * Whenever a free request arrives, it is again first bucketed based on the size (which must be passed in and *must* match 
 * allocation size). If it is larger than the largest bucket, it is passed through to a platform function BinnedFreeToOS().
 * Otherwise, the appropriate bucket's list of pools is walked to find the pool where the allocation belongs, and the 
 * appropriate block becomes free (a platform-specific function is called to evict the memory range from the RAM).
 * If this was the last used block in the pool, the whole pool is destroyed and the list shrinks by one.
 * 
 * So, to visualize an example state:
 * 
 *  64KB bucket:  Head -> [ A pool of 200 64KB "blocks", of which 50 are empty ] -> [ A pool of 100 64KB blocks, of which 30 are empty ] -> null
 * 128KB bucket:  Head -> [ A pool of 60 128KB "blocks", of which 25 are empty ] -> null
 * 192KB bucket:  Head -> null
 * 256KB bucket:  Head -> [ A pool of 40 256KB "blocks", of which 10 are empty ] -> [ A pool of 20 256KB blocks, of which 10 are emtpy ] -> [ A pool of 4 256 KB blocks of which 0 are empty ] -> null
 * ...
 *   4MB bucket:  Head -> [ A pool of 2 4MB "blocks", of which 1 is empty ] -> null
 * 
 * Each pool uses one distinct VMA on Linux (or one distinct VirtualAlloc on Windows).
 * 
 * The class also maintains an idea of what current size of each pool (per bucket) should be.
 * Each time we add a new pool to a particular bucket, this size can grow (exponentially or otherwise).
 * Each time we delete a pool from a particular bucket, this size can shrink.
 * The logic that handles that is in DecideOnTheNextPoolSize().
 * 
 * Right now the class is less multithread friendly than it could be. There are per-bucket locks
 * so allocations of different sizes would not block each other if happening on different threads.
 * It is possible to make allocations within one bucket lock-free as well (e.g. with hazard pointers), but 
 * since FMallocBinned2 itself needs a lock to maintain its own structures when making a call here,
 * the point is moot.
 * 
 * This class is somewhat similar to FCachedOSPageAllocator. However, unlike FCOSPA, this is not a cache
 * and we cannot "trim" anything here. Also, it does not make sense to put the global cap on the pooled memory
 * since BinnedAllocFromOS() can support only a limited number of allocations on some platforms.
 * 
 * CachedOSPageAllocator sits "below" this and is used for allocs larger than the largest bucketed.
