/**
 * Implements a lock-free first-in first-out queue using a circular array.
 *
 * This class is thread safe only in single-producer single-consumer scenarios.
 *
 * The number of items that can be enqueued is one less than the queue's capacity,
 * because one item will be used for detecting full and empty states.
 *
 * There is some room for optimization via using fine grained memory fences, but
 * the implications for all of our target platforms need further analysis, so
 * we're using the simpler sequentially consistent model for now.
