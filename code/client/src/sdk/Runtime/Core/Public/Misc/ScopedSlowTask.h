/**
 * A scope block representing an amount of work divided up into sections.
 * Use one scope at the top of each function to give accurate feedback to the user of a slow operation's progress.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *	void DoSlowWork()
 *	{
 *		FScopedSlowTask Progress(2.f, LOCTEXT("DoingSlowWork", "Doing Slow Work..."));
 *		// Optionally make this show a dialog if not already shown
 *		Progress.MakeDialog();
 *
 *		// Indicate that we are entering a frame representing 1 unit of work
 *		Progress.EnterProgressFrame(1.f);
 *		
 *		// DoFirstThing() can follow a similar pattern of creating a scope divided into frames. These contribute to their parent's progress frame proportionately.
 *		DoFirstThing();
 *		
 *		Progress.EnterProgressFrame(1.f);
 *		DoSecondThing();
 *	}
