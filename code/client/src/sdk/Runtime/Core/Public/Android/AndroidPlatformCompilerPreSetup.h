// Make certain warnings always be warnings, even despite -Werror.
// Rationale: we don't want to suppress those as there are plans to address them (e.g. UE-12341), but breaking builds due to these warnings is very expensive
// since they cannot be caught by all compilers that we support. They are deemed to be relatively safe to be ignored, at least until all SDKs/toolchains start supporting them.
