You can follow the following instructions to learn how to use this repository [here](https://github.com/MafiaHub/Framework#add-a-multi-player-project-to-the-framework)

## Current state

Actually, the mod isn't playable. It offers a stable and safe playground to experiment and reverse engineer the game:

- [x] DirectX 12 hooks for ImGUI rendering
- [x] Basic game structures reversing (world, players, components, containers etc...) under the SDK namespace
- [x] Fast game load
- [x] Game save bypass
- [x] Debug UI
- [x] Weather / time management (networked and script-exposed)
- [x] Battle-tested networking code with player entity basic information replication
- [x] Hooks
- [x]Â NodeJS scripting-enabled dedicated server

It does not cover (yet):

- [] Entity spawning (we had a prototype with cats but not working for players atm), we need to reverse StudentManager
- [] Gear synchronization
- [] World boundaries removal
- [] Web rendering for UIs
